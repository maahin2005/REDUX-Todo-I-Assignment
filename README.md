### todo with redux

### Instructions

### Todo App using Redux

- You are supposed to create a Todo application using Redux to manage its states. Create proper files and folders for Redux. Your app should have the following features:

- Users are able to add a Todo, update it (toggle its status and edit the title), and delete it.
- The above actions should be managed by Redux.
- Proper logic should be written inside the reducer and proper action creators should be created.
- Make sure to create an actionItems file that will help in avoiding errors while specifying action types.
- You should use Chakra UI in your app.
- Your app should also have a toggle theme option. Refer to this Chakra doc to know how to change theme using Chakra.
- App theme must be maintained by Redux. Create a separate reducer for the app theme.
- In order to use both reducers (todo and theme), use the combineReducers.

### Additional features:

- Add a login feature (use the https://reqres.in/ API) and maintain the authentication state via Redux. Users can only add todo if they are logged in. Be creative here; if you want to add any extra pages, feel free to do so.
